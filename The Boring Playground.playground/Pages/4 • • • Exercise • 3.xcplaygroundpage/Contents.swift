// MARK: Exercise N°3 - Your Friends Birthdays

/// Today, you will have to practice a bit.
/// Your mission, may you accept it is:
/// 1. Create a `Friend` `class` or `struct`
/// - The `Friend` class must contain these attributes:
/// - • firstname of type `String` (as a constant)
/// - • lastname of type `String` (as a constant)
/// - • birthdate of type `Date` (as a constant)
/// - The `Friend` class must contain these methods:
/// - • `greet` that should print `Hello (firstname and lastname)`
/// - • `introduceMyself` that should take an argument of type `Friend` and introduce to this friend
/// - • `myAge` that should print my age based on the date stored in the attribute `birthdate`
/// - • `ageDifference` that should take an argument of type `Friend` and print the difference between the current person and the friend passed as an argument
/// 2. Create a list of friends and iterate over it in order to try the different methods you just wrote.
